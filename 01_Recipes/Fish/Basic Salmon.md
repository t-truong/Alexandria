# Equipment

- Frying pan

# Ingredients
1) **Salmon** *\[1 ct\]*
   - Cut into palm-sized fillets
   - ==Skin-on is a requirement==
   - Recommended to fry from refrigerated state, helps prevent overcooking while giving crispy skin
   - Can also use `Steelhead Trout`
2) **Butter** *\[1 tsp per salmon fillet\]*
3) **Old Bay** *\[1 tsp per salmon fillet\]*

# Instructions
1) Pre-heat frying pan to high heat
2) Fry **salmon fillet** skin side down on high heat until ==starting to== golden brown
   - Approximately *5 minutes* but time varies
   - On non-stick pans, lift to check
   - On sticky pans, fillet will easily release when golden brown
3) Turn heat down to medium-low and let skin side finish browning on residue high heat
   - Listen for sizzle to die down to low volume to indicate medium-low pan temperature
4) Once pan temperature is medium-low, flip fillet to cook meat side
   - Fry on medium-low heat for *4 minutes per 1 cm thick* of salmon, assuming frying from refrigerated state
5) Add **Old Bay** to fillet then **butter** immediately after flipping so **butter** has time to melt and absorb
6) ==Serve salmon fillet==
