# Measurements and Units

This page explains terminologies relating to measurements and units used in all **recipes**

# Units

All ingredients will use either precise *metric units \[g, cm, mL\]* and/or *loose convenience units \[12 ct tomatoes, 1 garlic head, 2 tsp\]*

**For cooking recipes, quantities are approximate. There is considerable margin of error and also adjust amounts to personal palate.**

**For baking recipes, quantities should be exact as possible because of chemistry ratios.**

# Measurements

Practice good measurements practices and use common sense.
